## Priority queue
Is an abstract data type: In computer science, an abstract data type is a mathematical model for data types. 
An abstract data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user.

## Binary Heap
- A heap is a tree-based data structure in which all the nodes of the tree are in a specific order.
- **Priority queues are usually implemented with Heaps**
- There are many types of Heaps
- A binary Heap is a binary Tree that supports **Heap invariant**
- A **Binary Tree** In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two
 children**, which are referred to as the left child and the right child
 - **Complete Binary Tree** is a tree in which every level is completely filled, possibly except the last
 - Binary Tree can be store in an array, store each layer in a sequence so that:
   - Left child index = 2*i + 1
   - Right child index = 2*i + 1 

## Where Priority queues and Heap used
- Shortest path algorithm 
- Lossless data compression
- Breadth First Search
